# Rust Firmware for the Charybdis Nano keyboard

This firmware written in Rust is targetted for the
[Charybdis Nano keyboard](https://bastardkb.com/product/charybdis-nano-kit/).
It uses the [Elite-C Holder](https://github.com/Bastardkb/Elite-C-holder) with
a [Liatris Microcontroller](https://splitkb.com/products/liatris).

Two modifications have been made on the Elite-C Holder:

- The handness of the keyboard is detected by adding a 5.1kOhm resistor on R6
  marking.  The firmware reads the value on pin 15 of the MCU to detect the
  handness of the keyboard.  On the left side, the value is 0 since it is
  connected to the Ground pin.  On the right side, the value is 1 since it
  is connected to the VCC pin.
- A wire has been added between the pin 29 of the MCU and the unmarked pin of
  the jack connector.  The pin 29 was supposed to control the R1 row of the
  keyboard but it does not exist on the Nano model.  This way, full duplex
  communication is possible between the two halves of the keyboard.

The firmware is based on the [Keyberon library](https://github.com/TeXitoi/keyberon).

## Features

- Multi layers keymaps
- Multiple keymaps
- Hold Tap actions
- Sequences
- CapsLock & NumLock
- RGB underglow on per key basis
- Switch to bootloader mode to easily upgrade firmware by pressing a key combination
- Auto-mouse mode: some keys act as mouse keys after the trackball has been
  used

## On CapsLock & NumLock support

The firmware generates an event on Col 0, Row 3 when the CapsLock led changes
states.  This is not a wired element but can be used to support CapsLock on
the keymap, to have a different behavior when CapsLock is set.

The same occurs with NumLock but the event is on Col 1, Row 3.

## On RGB underglow

Few modes are available for the RGB underglow:

 - `Off`: The RGB underglow is Off
 - `SolidColor`: The RGB underglow is set to a static Color
 - `Wheel`: The RGB underglow cycles through the colors of the rainbow
 - `Pulse`: The RGB underglow pulses with a static color
 - `PulseRainbow`: The RGB underglow pulses with the colors of the rainbow,
   each pulse being a different color
 - `Input`: Each key pressed will light up the RGB underglow with a different
   color
 - `InputSolid`: Each key pressed will light up the RGB underglow with a
   static color

On communication error, the RGB underglow will be lit in red.

The first 8 layers each have a different color for the RGB underglow.  They
are lid when a layer is active and the mode is not `Off`.

## What's missing

- Support for controlling the trackball when the keyboard is plugged on the
  left side.
- Mouse acceleration
- Combos
- One Shot Actions
- Hamming codes to improve the reliability of the communication between the
  two halves of the keyboard
- ...


## Installing the needed tools

Considering one has rust installed by [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs), then
one has to run the following commands:

```shell
cargo install cargo-binutils
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
cargo install probe-rs --features cli
cargo install elf2uf2-rs
```

## Compile & Flashing

The possible keymaps are:

- `keymap_basic`
- `keymap_borisfaure`
- `keymap_test`

### With probe-rs

In case a [probe-rs](https://probe.rs/) compatible debugger is available, the
firmware can be flashed using the following command for the `keymap_basic`:

```shell
cargo f --release --no-default-features --features="keymap_borisfaure"
```

### By installing a UF2 file on the device

The firmware can be compiled to a UF2 file using the following command:

```shell
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features="keymap_basic"
elf2uf2-rs target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/cnano-rs cnano-rs.uf2
```

Then, the UF2 file can be copied to the device.
